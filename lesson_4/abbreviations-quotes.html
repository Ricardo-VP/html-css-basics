    <p>Martin Luther King, Jr. once said <q>I have a  dream</q>.</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://news.un.org/es/story/2020/06/1475532">
        <p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out 
            the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be 
            self-evident, that all.
